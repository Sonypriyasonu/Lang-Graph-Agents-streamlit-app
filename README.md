# LangGraph Agent Explorer

**LangGraph Agent Explorer** is an interactive **Streamlit-based application** that demonstrates the power of **agentic AI workflows** using **LangGraph**. This project allows users to **create, visualize, and execute** different types of LangGraph agent graphs, including **single-agent, multi-agent, and cyclic (looping) graphs**. A special use case is implemented as a **Resume Qualification Checker**, which evaluates uploaded resumes against a predefined job description using a **cyclic agent graph**.

## Features

### Single Agent Graph
- Executes a **single LLM-driven agent**.
- Accepts **user input** (query, prompt, or topic) and returns the output generated by the agent.
- Visualizes the **graph flow** in the Streamlit sidebar.

### Multi-Agent Graph
- Chains **multiple agents** (`Researcher → Writer → Editor`) for more complex workflows.
- Each agent performs a dedicated task:
  - **Researcher**: Gathers information and insights on the given topic.
  - **Writer**: Generates content based on the research output.
  - **Editor**: Refines the content for grammar, style, and readability.
- Visualizes the **multi-agent flow** using **Graphviz**.

### Cyclic Graph / Resume Qualification Checker
- Special use case for **HR/Recruitment scenarios**.
- Allows users to **upload a PDF resume**.
- Extracts resume text and compares it against a **Job Description**.
- Uses a **cyclic graph** to loop evaluation until approval/rejection is determined.
- Outputs a **JSON-like evaluation** with reasons for approval or rejection.
- Includes **graph visualization** of the resume review flow.

### PDF Text Extraction
- Uses **PyPDF2** to extract text from uploaded PDF resumes.
- Previews extracted content in the **Streamlit interface**.

### Integration with LLMs
- Powered by **Google Gemini** (via `langchain_google_genai`).
- Uses **LLMChain** and **PromptTemplates** to dynamically construct prompts for each agent.
- Supports **agentic reasoning** with multi-step workflows.

### Interactive Streamlit UI
- **Sidebar** for selecting use cases and visualizing graph flow.
- **Tabs** for multi-agent outputs.
- **Buttons** for executing agents and evaluating resumes.
